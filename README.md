# Hide-n-Seek

![treasure-found](https://github.com/MaybeNotABob/Hide-n-Seek/blob/main/screenshot/ss-treasure.png)

__Description__ 

A simple educational project I have used for learning about std::filestream - C++ 17.

Hide a .txt file *(treasure)* within a directory hierarchy.
The depth of the directory structure can be control by adjusting the const value.
directory names are randomly generated strings.


__Compile__

run the make file 
```./make release``` 

or 

```clang++ -Wall -std=c++17 *.cpp -o hide.exe```
